# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

## Red-Green-Refactor

1. **RED:** Write a failing test and verify it fails correctly.
2. **GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass the test and verify it passes.
3. **REFACTOR:** Clean up duplication and names while keeping tests green.
